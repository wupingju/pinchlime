description: 這個網站 Pin 起來 ／ Pinchlime.com 是由我自己一個人獨立經營的部落格，主要是拿來放我寫的各種關於生產力工具、生產力方法論、工作流（workflow）、以及其他各種雜談的文章。

Hi, this website, 「Pin 起來」 (Pinchlime.com) , is a blog run by myself, mainly for my articles on productivity tools, productivity methodology, workflows, and other miscellaneous topics.

The meaning of 「Pin 起來」 in chinese is that "to pin something". 

I often say that I want to Pin this conversation when I discuss it with my colleagues, so I have a small hope that after reading my articles, you can pin many of them in your own records.

On the other hand, "Pinchlime" is a self-created word that sounds a bit like the Chinese word 「Pin 起來」, and the word meaning is also a bit similar to "Punchline", but with Punch changed to Pinch and Line changed to Lime.


## About the setup of Pinchlime

Prior to April 2022, this blog was primarily built through wordpress.com, and since April 17, 2022, it has been deployed through [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static website generator, plus [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a website that allows people to host websites, Github and other tools. 

Through these tools and services, I can write markdown formatted text and generate this site very quickly and directly.

I first saw Owen Young share the article [Migrating blogs and wikis to Zola](https://www.owenyoung.com/blog/migrate-to-zola/) on Twitter, and started to study the "Static Site Generator", and then I followed the official Zola documentation and Owen's source code to set up the site.

I am very grateful to Owen for opening source of his site and answering key questions I had during the build process for me.

I haven't fully open sourced this site yet (because I'm not sure how well I've changed a lot of the code), but if you're interested in building a site through Zola, please feel free to contact me to discuss.

## About Me

I worked as a legislator assistant in Congress of Taiwan, then moved to a YouTube channel as a planner and PM, and now I work as a PM and operator in the web design department of the same company.

I like to experiment with different software and services, and write and share my experiences and introductory articles with you.

Currently, there are three levels of content planning.

- Short articles of random thoughts, immature discussions, and insights on real-time events will be posted on [My Twitter](https://twitter.com/WuPingJu).

- Medium-length essays, essays, and excerpts from articles will be posted on my [Pin Up Newsletter](https://pinchlime.substack.com/). (I plan to put the text back on the blog soon)

- Longer productivity tools, productivity methodology presentations and discussions will continue to be posted on Pinchlime website.
