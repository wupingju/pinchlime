## About Pinchlime

Hi，I'm PJ Wu, welcome to my personal site!

**Pinchlime** is a blog independently operated by me. Its content includes various articles I have written about productivity tools, productivity methodologies, workflows, and other miscellaneous topics. It also includes backups of my newsletters and "thought snapshots.

The Mandarin name of this blog is "Pin 起來", which means "To Pin this". I have always liked this term and often use it when discussing with my colleagues, saying that we should "pin this" conversation. So I named the blog with this name, hoping that after reading my articles, readers can pin many of the introductions or ideas in their own records.

As for Pinchlime, it is a word I created myself. It sounds a bit like "Pin 起來" in Mandarin, and its meaning is somewhat similar to "Punchline." However, I changed "Punch" to "Pinch" and "Line" to "Lime."
