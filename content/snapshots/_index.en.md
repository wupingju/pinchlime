Hi, the "Snapshots" page you are currently viewing is a dedicated space on this website for "immature ideas." The content here is mostly short, consisting of only two or three lines of text, without specific organization or structure.

These are the ideas I jot down from various perspectives in my daily life. Currently, there are four main types, covering topics I'm interested in and their corresponding answers, random short thoughts, interesting discoveries, and things I have tried.

The reason they are named "Snapshots" is that these ideas or attempts mostly remain in the moment they were recorded. I may not think the same way after a while, and I won't come back to update the content. Therefore, the content in Snapshots only represents my thoughts at a specific moment, with the intensity fading over time. However, I believe that accumulating ideas still holds meaning, so I will still post these Snapshots and leave a record.

Feel free to browse down or click on the categories below that interest you the most!

-  [Daily Why](/kinds/daily-why): This section contains "Why" questions that I am curious about. They mainly revolve around motivation, choices, or the reasons behind certain phenomena. Currently, I spend more time recording these questions.
-  [What I Found Interesting](/kinds/what-i-found-interesting/): This section features interesting things I have discovered, such as new products or methodologies.
-  [What I Tried Today](/kinds/what-i-tried-today/): Here, I document things I have recently tried that I haven't done before. It could be starting to use a new tool or changing the content of a workflow.
-  [Random Thoughts](/kinds/random-thoughts/): This section contains random thoughts or ideas that don't fit into any specific category. It's a mix, but it may closely reflect my current thinking and is somewhat similar to "Fleeting Notes."
