1. Optimism, obsession, self-belief, raw horsepower and personal connections are how things get started.

    樂觀、著迷、自信、原始動力和人與人之間的連結是事物開始的方式。

2. Cohesive teams, the right combination of calmness and urgency, and unreasonable commitment are how things get finished. Long-term orientation is in short supply; try not to worry about what people think in the short term, which will get easier over time.

    凝聚力強的團隊、冷靜與緊迫感的完美結合，以及不講理的投入是完成事物的方式。長期導向的思維並不普遍；嘗試不去擔心人們的短期看法，這會隨著時間變得更容易。

3. It is easier for a team to do a hard thing that really matters than to do an easy thing that doesn’t really matter; audacious ideas motivate people.

    對於團隊來說，做一件真正重要的難事比做一件不那麼重要的容易事更為容易；大膽的想法能激勵人。

4. Incentives are superpowers; set them carefully.
    激勵措施是超能力；要謹慎設定它們。

5. Concentrate your resources on a small number of high-conviction bets; this is easy to say but evidently hard to do. You can delete more stuff than you think.

    將資源集中在少數高信心的賭注上；這話說起來容易，做起來卻明顯困難。你可以刪除的東西比你想的還要多。

6. Communicate clearly and concisely.

    清晰、簡潔地溝通。

7. Fight bullshit and bureaucracy every time you see it and get other people to fight it too. Do not let the org chart get in the way of people working productively together.

    每當你看到廢話和官僚主義就去抵抗，也要讓其他人一起抵抗。不要讓組織架構妨礙人們有效地共同合作。

8. Outcomes are what count; don’t let good process excuse bad results.

    結果是最重要的；不要讓良好的過程成為糟糕結果的藉口。

9. Spend more time recruiting. Take risks on high-potential people with a fast rate of improvement. Look for evidence of getting stuff done in addition to intelligence.

    花更多時間在招募上。冒險投資於那些潛力巨大且進步迅速的人。除了智力之外，也尋找對方是否有把事情搞定的證據。

10. Superstars are even more valuable than they seem, but you have to evaluate people on their net impact on the performance of the organization.

    超級巨星比他們看起來的還要有價值，但在評估他們的時候要看他們對組織績效的整體貢獻。

11. Fast iteration can make up for a lot; it’s usually ok to be wrong if you iterate quickly. Plans should be measured in decades, execution should be measured in weeks.

    快速迭代可以彌補很多事；如果你快速迭代，犯錯通常是可以接受的。計畫應該以十年為單位衡量，執行則應該以星期為單位衡量。

12. Don’t fight the business equivalent of the laws of physics.

    不要與商業上等同於物理定律的事物作對。

13. Inspiration is perishable and life goes by fast. Inaction is a particularly insidious type of risk.

    靈感會消逝，人生轉瞬即逝。不採取行動是一種特別隱蔽的風險。

14. Scale often has surprising emergent properties.

    擴張時往往會有讓人驚喜的新效應。

15. Compounding exponentials are magic. In particular, you really want to build a business that gets a compounding advantage with scale.

    指數成長有魔力。特別是，你真的想建立一個隨著規模擴張而獲得指數成長優勢的企業。

16. Get back up and keep going.

    重新站起來，繼續前進。

17. Working with great people is one of the best parts of life.

    與優秀的人一起做事是人生中最美好的部分之一。
